# PA10: Pinball

### Information
Features include custom models and a GUI. This is a simple pinball game with two paddles, a plunger, and a whole bunch of bumpers. Separate models were made for static collision meshes so that concave collisions would behave corrrectly and predictably.

### Libraries needed
GLEW, GLM, SDL, Assimp 3.3.1, Magick++, Bullet 2.87

### Build instructions
Create a build folder called build and do ```cmake ..``` inside of it.

Build from within the PA9/build directory via the make file generated by cmake. Simply do ```make``` to build and ```make clean``` to remove the build files.

Run the program by doing ```./Tutorial``` after building the program. 

Ensure that you don't remove the build folder entirely, as the assets folder exists in both the PA9 and build directory due to root directory differences between the IDE and Ubuntu.

### additional notes

note: uses assimp version 3.3.1
note: uses magick++ (sudo apt-get install libmagick++-dev)
note: uses bullet 2.87 (build and do make install)

k to load sphere

g to use left paddle
h to use right paddle
b to launch ball
t and y to toggle between fragment and vertex shading

You start with three lives. Once you lose them, it's game over.
To activate multiball, just load multiple balls onto the plunger. Note: it only works if you have lives to spare.
1000 points earns another life.
