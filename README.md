# PinBallGame

 Abstractive methods

This component requires you to complete the following two tasks. (I) Develop a playable online 3D t pi bowling game with rules similar to a physical ten pin bowling game that can be played by a good number of online players, with potential to scale up for massive online players; (2) Write a thnnal report covering the development details of the game, and your insights on the challenges, solutions, programming languages and skills regarding large-scale programming issues. The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate your capability in evaluating, proposing and implementing solutions for a large scale programming problem, and your deep unders.ding of different object-oriented programming languages and state-of-the-art tools for large scale programming issues. Your development can recycle and extend the materials used in the module workshops. Please note that it still needs significant modification to the provided system design and implementation to meet the requirements. Alternatively, you can opt for implementing your own GUI-based game from scratch addressing the massive online challenges. To meet the minimum requirement, your developed online game should allow at least 100 online players to play at the same time. The detailed technical requirements are detailed below. Please note that you are expected to submit the report on your development addressing these requirementh below, along with all source code and project files of your system. The Playable Online Gantt Similarly to the C., classes Ball, Table, Cushion and Players - designed or restmctured during the workshops - you are required to think carefully about the classes you will design and implement to make a playable online ten pin bowling game suitable for .ge number of players with potential to scale up for massive online players. To complete a playable game, the following classes and efTects must be implemented.

 1. Lanes A lane shows the area for two players to play the game with certain layouts. The online game will have multiple tracks or courses allowing multiple players to pair with and play at the same time. This means that a lane class should be designed and implemented, and your game should support large number of lanes, at least 5 lanes for demonstration. 

2. Balls and pins Add programmatic ball and pin classes to the lanes. This will require the design and implementation of new classes to support the attributes and functionality of a ball/pin. You will then be able to add ball/pin objects to the lanes, implement a method for detecting a ball/pin's collisions and positions, and construct a system for managing balls/pins/scores. Typically, there are one object ball plus ten pins for a lane. Your game should allow 2 players playing in each lane.
